        <p>
            Let me not to the marriage of                true minds <br>
            Admit impediments. Love is not               love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
