        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
        
        <p>The <em>horse</em> is awesome because horses have a strong sense of hearing, able to pick up sounds in the <strong> 55–33,500 hertz range</strong>, so they can hear things that humans (who can hear between 20–20,000 hertz) miss. In addition, horses can see very well, with a nearly 360-degree field of vision, and their eyes are larger than those of any land mammal. Foals Can Stand, Run, and Trot Shortly After Birth.</p>
